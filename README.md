# Team_Profile_Generator


# Description

This command-line application uses Node.js to take in user input to generate an HTML 'team profile' webpage. The user is prompted with questions in the terminal about employees on a software engineering team, and then the HTML webpage displays those profile summaries for each person on the page. The profiles will display email addresses and a GitHub username that when clicked, directs the user to the default email program and GitHub profile in a new tab.
